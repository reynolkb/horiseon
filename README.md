# horiseon webpage

## Description

This is a mockup for the horiseon company's webpage. The website is designed to give clients a place to lookup the Horiseon company and see what services they provide. This code has been updated and organized to meet accessibility standards.

I have updated the HTML div elements and replaced them with the appropriate tags like section, nav, header and footer. The CSS classes have been combined since there were multiple classes using the same code.
